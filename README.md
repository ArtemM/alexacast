# alexacast

Alexa skill to control local Chromecast devices. Check out the documentation on
[alexandra](https://github.com/erik/alexandra) for setup instructions. You'll
need to run it on the same network as your Chromecast.

## usage

(assuming your trigger word is "chromecast")

- "alexa, ask chromecast to skip this"
- "alexa, ask chromecast to pause"
- "alexa, ask chromecast to play"
- "alexa, ask chromecast to reconnect"
  - if everything stops working this might fix it
- "alexa, ask chromecast to reboot"
  - sometimes the chromecast gets itself into dumb states and needs to be
    restarted.
